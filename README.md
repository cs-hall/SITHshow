<h1 align='center'>SITH (Scale-Invariant Temporal History)</h1>

## Overview

SITHshow is a library showcasing applications of the neurally inspired [SITH](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/24/1/134/7733/A-Scale-Invariant-Internal-Representation-of-Time) representation of working memory for use in neural networks.

## Installation
TODO

## Examples

Work through the notebooks in Google Colab...

Get started with SITH

- cme demo

Train on one scale, generalize to many with SITHCon

- Morse Decoder (suitable to run on cpu)
- AudioMNIST (more computationally intensive)

Efficiently learn latent number lines with CNL

- odometer (suitable to run on cpu) 

## More SITH

TODO do we put papers here?

DeepSITH
RL SITH
etc.
