<h1 align='center'>SITHshow: Scale-Invariant Temporal History Showcase</h1>

## Overview

SITHshow is a library showcasing applications of the neurally inspired [SITH](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/24/1/134/7733/A-Scale-Invariant-Internal-Representation-of-Time) representation of working memory for use in neural networks. Because SITH has a fuzzy memory of the past, it can often outperform RNNs and deep learning models with fixed buffers.

## Installation
TODO

Requires Python 3.9+ and JAX 0.4.13+.

## Examples

Work through the notebooks in Google Colab...

**Get started with SITH**

- [CME Demo](https://github.com/compmem/SITHshow/blob/main/examples/cme_demo.ipynb)

**Train on one scale, generalize to many with SITHCon**

- [Morse Decoder](https://github.com/compmem/SITHshow/blob/main/examples/morse_code.ipynb) (suitable to run on cpu)
- [AudioMNIST](https://github.com/compmem/SITHshow/blob/main/examples/audio_mnist.ipynb) (more computationally intensive)

**Efficiently learn latent number lines with CNL**

- [Odometer](https://github.com/compmem/SITHshow/blob/main/examples/odometer.ipynb) (suitable to run on cpu) 

## More SITH

TODO do we put papers here?

DeepSITH
RL SITH
